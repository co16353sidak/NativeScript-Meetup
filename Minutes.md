# The Flow of the Meetup was as follows.

### 1. Introduction
As soon as everyone had arrived we started with introductions, wherein i asked everyone what ther level of experience was with developing Mobile or Web Applications.
It was discovered that mostly all were at a beginer level and so it was decided to keep the tutorial light and simple covering only the basics of NativeScript and how it can be used.

## 2. The Tutorial
I took a 30-45 mins tutorial/follow-along in which i asked everyone to follow along with me as i set up NativeScript on another browser, everyone made their accounts and logged onto the playground.
I further progressed through the playground tutorial showing everyone how to begin with NativeScript,
1. Writing basic markup
2. Using css for styling and the difference from actual css and NativeScript css
3. A short introudtion to javascript for the application, a small example using console logs to explain how it will work.

## 3. Discussion/Talk
Then when this was over, i had an interactive session with the students, while most were my juniors in college so they had little to no knowledge of NativeScript, it was nice to widen their horizen on the benefits and work of NatveScript.
Answered some questions, showed sample apps to demonstrate the capabilities of NativeScript.

## 4. Ending
We ended with some feedback from the students and after that refreshments were served wherein i also interacted with more people and finally drew the event to a close.
